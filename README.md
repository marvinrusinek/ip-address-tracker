# IpAddressTracker


The challenge is to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To get the IP Address locations, I am using the IP Geolocation API by IPify. To generate the map, I am using LeafletJS.

The users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size (IN PROGRESS)
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP Address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location
